okay steam wont load games

I believe this is the main error:

(process:35225): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: 13:14:13.726: g_object_unref: assertion 'G_IS_OBJECT (object)' failed
reaping pid: 35225 -- gameoverlayui

Troubleshooting steps:
 try different launch options


Have tried:
* Cleared Steam Download Cache
* STEAM_RUNTIME_PREFER_HOST_LIBRARIES=0 steam
* installing everything i could find relating to "mesa"
* installing firmware-linux-nonfree libgl1-mesa-dri xserver-xorg-video-intel
* installing libtcmalloc-minimal4
* other games
* reinstalling steam
* restart
* using old proton
* verify install/reinstall. It said that it cant find models earlier in the log.
* wayland
* STEAM_RUNTIME=0 steam
** This one breaks steam
* flakpak
