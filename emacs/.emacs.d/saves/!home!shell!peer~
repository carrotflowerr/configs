pro:
The opening and hook were great. The thesis was stated and it gave a good idea of the rest of the essay.

The topic itself is very interesting

The examples were good, and the situations in them were explained well.

con:
I think refering back to the thesis and how it relates to the example at the end would be helpful

Jumping from example to example is a great structure for an essay but it feels a bit jarring
